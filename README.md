Hello,

I created this repository to showcase my completed notebooks and PowerPoint for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project, which involves predicting the success of Space X Falcon 9 first stage landings. The notebook files were completed as part of the project assignment, and all necessary data is hosted online. However, the data for the dashboard project is included in the repository.

Please note that some files, such as the Plotly Dashboard and Folium Visualizations, need to be run externally as they are not interactive on GitHub. They should run without any issues through Jupyter environments on your local computer.

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the project!
